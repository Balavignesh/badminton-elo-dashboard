# Poker Elo Dashboard

A generalized version of Elo to track the results of our friendly poker games.

The dashboard is deployed on Heroku: https://poker-elo-dashboard.herokuapp.com

The Elo calculations are performed using my [multielo](https://github.com/djcunningham0/multielo)
package. Follow that link to reach the GitHub page for the package, which includes
documentation and methodology for the generalized (multiplayer) Elo calculations.
